### Hey!

- ✨ My pet project is [Variance, my beloved](https://github.com/ansuleymanova/variance-my-beloved) - statistical calculators with responsive layout and reasonably cool design, hosted [here](https://variance.monster) (russian only atm).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js, Next.js & Typescript
- 🫧 I’m looking to collaborate on tutorial translations (russian/english and vice versa), fun DnD apps and apps for sociological research and statistical analysis
