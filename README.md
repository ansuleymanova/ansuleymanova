### Hey!

- ✨ My pet project is [Variance, my beloved](https://github.com/ansuleymanova/variance-my-beloved) - statistical calculators with responsive layout and reasonably cool design, hosted [here]([https://variance.monster](https://ansuleymanova.github.io/variance-my-beloved/) (russian only atm).
- 👀 My primary interest aside from general programming is UX. I want to make stuff nicer to use and more accessible
- 🌱 My primary stack is React.js, Next.js & Typescript
- 🫧 I’m looking to collaborate on tutorial translations (russian/english and vice versa), fun DnD apps and apps for sociological research or statistical analysis
- 🤳🏼 How to reach me: @ansuleymanova on Telegram or by mail in my profile
